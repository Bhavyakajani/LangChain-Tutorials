Title: Allow Santa's reindeer's to run on the surface of water

Description:
When delivering gift on a hot climate, typically in the region between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn,
due to a relatively warm weather the water is warm enough to not freeze in smaller river bodies.
So at times when the weather is foggy, Santa needs to go over the water. Currently, he needs to go around them.
To make the gift deliveries much faster Santa's reindeer's should be able to run over water efficiently.

Acceptance criteria:

AC1 – Water Detection

Given Santa is delivering in a warm-climate region,
When a water body is detected ahead during foggy weather
Then the system must activate Water Run Mode.

AC2 – Reindeer Water Run

Given Water Run Mode is active,
When the reindeer's begin crossing the water,
Then they must run over the surface without sinking or slowing down.

AC3 – Route Optimization

Given a water body lies between Santa and the destination
When Water Run Mode is available
Then the route must be optimized to cross the water instead of going around it.
